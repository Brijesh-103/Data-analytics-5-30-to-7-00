# What is python?
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. 
It was created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991. 
Python's design philosophy emphasizes code readability and allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code compared to other programming languages.
Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
It has a large standard library that provides a wide range of modules and functions for various tasks, making it a versatile language for web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more. 
Python's popularity has grown significantly over the years, and it is widely used in both academia and industry for various applications. 
Its simplicity and ease of use make it an excellent choice for beginners, while its powerful features and extensive libraries make it a favorite among experienced developers.

## how to install python?
To install Python, follow these steps:
Step 1: Go to the official Python website at https://www.python.org/downloads/.
Step 2: Check version using `python --version` or `python3 --version` in your terminal or command prompt to see if Python is already installed on your system.

## how to run python code?
To run Python code, you can use the following methods:
1. **Interactive Mode**: Open a terminal or command prompt and type `python` or `python3` to start the Python interactive shell. You can then type Python code directly into the shell and press Enter to execute it.
2. **Script Mode**: Create a Python file with a `.py` extension (e.g., `script.py`) and write your Python code in that file. Then, open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory where the file is located, and run the command `python script.py` or `python3 script.py` to execute the script.
3. **Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: Use an IDE such as PyCharm, Visual Studio Code, or Jupyter Notebook to write and run Python code. These IDEs provide features such as code completion, debugging, and project management, making it easier to develop Python applications.


## What are keywords in python?
Keywords in Python are reserved words that have a specific meaning and purpose in the language. 
They cannot be used as identifiers (such as variable names, function names, or class names) because they are reserved for specific syntactic constructs and operations in Python. 
Keywords are an essential part of the Python language and are used to define the structure and behavior of Python code.
They include words like:
- `False`, 
- `None`, 
- `True`, 
- `and`, 
- `as`, 
- `assert`, 
- `async`, 
- `await`, 
- `break`, 
- `class`, 
- `continue`, 
- `def`, 
- `del`, 
- `elif`, 
- `else`, 
- `except`, 
- `finally`, 
- `for`, 
- `from`, 
- `global`, 
- `if`, 
- `import`, 
- `in`, 
- `is`, 
- `lambda`, 
- `nonlocal`, 
- `not`, 
- `or`, 
- `pass`,
- `raise`, 
- `return`, 
- `try`, 
- `while`, 
- `with`, 
- `yield`
