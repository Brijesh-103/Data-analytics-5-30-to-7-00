# What is URL?

- A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is the address used to access resources on the internet, such as web pages, images, videos, and files.

- It specifies the location of a resource and the protocol used to retrieve it, allowing users to easily find and access online content.

- ### Components of a URL:

  1. **Protocol**: Indicates the method used to access the resource (e.g., HTTP, HTTPS, FTP).

  2. **Domain Name**: The human-readable address of the website (e.g., www.example.com).

  3. **Path**: Specifies the specific location of the resource on the server (e.g., /folder/page.html).

  4. **Query Parameters**: Additional information passed to the server (e.g., ?id=123&sort=asc).

  5. **Fragment**: A reference to a specific section within the resource (e.g., #section1).

- URLs are essential for navigating the web, as they provide a standardized way to locate and access resources.

- They can be shared via hyperlinks, allowing users to click and be directed to the desired content.

- Understanding the structure and components of a URL is important for web development, SEO, and online marketing.

- URLs can also include special characters and encoding to represent spaces and other non-alphanumeric characters.

- Properly formatted URLs are crucial for ensuring that web browsers and servers can correctly interpret and process requests for resources.
